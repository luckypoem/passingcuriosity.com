Java is a language, a platform and a process (the JCP). A lot of people say
Java is dead but the JVM is doing very well indeed, the language and the
process might be in a bit of trouble.

Linux JVM options: OpenJDK, Oracle Java, GNU Classpath (w/ GCJ), Apache
Harmony. Also: the Dalvik VM from Android.

Lots of alternatives to Java the Language.

Groovy (super Java), dynamically typed, clear migration path, well
established, closures, DSLs and Builders, Groovy++ makes it static. Grails,
Gradle, Griffon, Gaelyk, GPars.

Scala: statically types, pseudo-functional, built-in concurrency, big users.

Clojure: lisp dialect, dynamic, functional, good concurrency.

Also ports of various languages to JVM: JRuby, Jyhton, Rhino. And more:
jerleng, resin (PHP), jaskell, jsqueak, jacl (TCL)...

Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJIDEA.

J OSS: Apache, codehaus, project lenai, java.net, etc.

Quite a few web frameworks.

And piles and piles of "enterprise" (lots of it fairly OSS).

JCP
===

The Java Community Process which takes Java Specification Requests (JSR) and
manages them. The process is having problems and may even be falling apart
(Apache Foundation).

Doubts
======

The language is the COBOL of our time? The platform is, however, very strong. 

The language is in trouble, JCP is probably dead, maybe forks in OpenJDK, lots
of patents.
