title : F#: Now Open

Like O'Caml.

Type inference (thought the inline annotations look a bit strange).

Comprehensions: lists, arrays, lazy sequences.

Tuples (`(,)`, `*` as in ML).

Records: ML syntax.

Discriminated unions (multiple constructors with O'Caml syntax)

Enums

Pattern matching on these.

Higher-order functions. Partial application of functions is not currying.
Doesn't need names. Application is the other way around.

Functional composition with `<<` and `>>` (which compose the functions in a
different order).

Is `let mutable` with `<-` really modifying mutable variables or rebinding in
lexical scopes? Seems like the refs make this useless functionality.

Measure types: `[<Measure>] type m` and `val x : float<m>`.

Lazy computations: lazy is specified at call like so `lazy fib 35`.

Monads: new type with Delay, Bind and Return.

Quotations.

Extensible modules (does O'Caml do this?)

MonoDevelop plugin to support F#. Requires a recent version of Mono; get both
Mono and F# from GitHub.
