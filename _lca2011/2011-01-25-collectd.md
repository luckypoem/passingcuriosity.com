En-Visage-ing system and instrumented statistics by Lindsay Holmwood

You encounter a perceived load time increase, perhaps the occasional time out,
but you're using something like Puppet, so everything *should* be the same. So
you collect data, etc.

`sysstat`, `dstat`, etc. Difficult to correlate these data with their
different formats, aggregates, etc. Use `collectd` to collect and store the
data. Lightweight, network-aware `collectd` instances on machines sending
stats about their performance to central monitoring station.

Now you need to graph the data. `collectd` stores its stats in RRD. The main
problem with RRD is RRDTool and its petty ordinary capabilities. So `visage`
which turns data in a RRD into JSON, turned into SVG with JS, etc. for your
browser.

Install `apt-get install librrd-ruby ruby-dev rubygems collectd`

Use the `curl_json` plugin for `collectd` to collect statistics of your own
applications.
