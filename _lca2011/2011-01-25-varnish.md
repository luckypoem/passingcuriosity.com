title : Varnish
---

10-30,000 visits over 48 hours.

Typical setup: Tubes -> Web server -> Application -> Database

5-10 hits / second is pretty good.

Put in a data cache (memcache) will get you up to ~100 hits / second. Put in a
page cache ~ 300 hits / second. More and you put in a load balancer,
clustering, etc. Lots of time and money.

Why do you need to go all the way back to the application to cache pages? A
web accelerator will give you 1k-5k hits / second. 20K+ with tuning.

Examples:

- Varnish
- Squid
- Nginx
- Lighttpd
- Apache
- Perlbal
- Pound

How cacheable is it?

Images, JS, CSS : extremely.

HTML: it depends.

You need to keep the hit rate high, but the load down.

1. Expire
2. Flush caches
3. Do silly things like send the same thing to everyone and change it with JS.

Cleaning up
==========

Tidy up URLs so you're always serving (and caching) canonical URLs.

Redirect mobiles.

Use grace time to keep serving an expired object while you're getting a fresh
copy from the backend.

Turn off deflate.

Check expiry times for different types of object.

Set grace time based on health of backend (set your grace to 1h if the backend
is down).

Using ESI to include the low-TTL bits of the page so that you can cache the
page for a long time and include the other bits separately. There are caveats
in varnish's support for ESI currently.

You need to be able to blow away objects in the cache in case of, e.g., logo
or branding changes.
