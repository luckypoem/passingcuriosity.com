About me
========

I am a web developer in Perth, Western Australia. I work with a variety of
software but prefer free and open source software; open interoperable
standards; and beverages containing either alcohol or caffeine (but not both).

I blog here at [Passing Curiosity][pc], I post photographs at [Flickr][fl] and
tweets (we're still calling them "tweets" aren't we?) at [Twitter][tw]. I use
[Delicious][dl] to bookmark pages I'll want to see later and [GitHub][gh] to
store my Git repository.

Once in a blue moon I visit [Reddit][rd], [Digg][di], and [Hacker News][hn]. I
rarely use [LinkedIn][li] and will close my [Facebook][fb] account one of
these days.
