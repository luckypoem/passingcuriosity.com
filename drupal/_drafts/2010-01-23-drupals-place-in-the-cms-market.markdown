Last year, spoke about the problems with selling Drupal:

* Modular vs ???
* Configurable vs Customisable

Mid Tier : $100-500 K

CMS Matrix lists 1103 different systems. CMS Watch are a consultancy who
release an annual report (42 in 2009).

Drupal vs Others
================

Sitecore, EPiServer, Drupal, MySourceMatrix

**"Features" in core**: 96, 106, 51?, 99.

**3rd party modules**: 360, 309, ~5000, 0.

**Edit modes**: Drupal lacks the "backend" edit that the others all have
(Sitecore has Windows/Word integration as well)

Large proportion of license fees pay for sales process, maintenance fees pay
for development. Being cheap - often by ignoring the "cost of sale" - is a bad
thing: you might wind up being discounted as cowboys and you'll lose out
having to engage in the same circus (but without the cost of sale to pay for
it).

The Drupal sales process can be more expensive than the proprietary solutions:
preparing a demonstration of required features in Drupal can be very nearly
building the site.

The editing interfaces scare users: not having a "backend".
