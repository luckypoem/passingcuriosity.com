States of Drupal Learnedness by Jonathan Yankovitch.

How buildings learn. Architectural patterns.

Angie 

* Site documentation module
* Document module choices, roles, etc., etc. and update it.
* Engage with community, Planet, issue queue.

Emma

* Build install profiles based on your "standard" rollout/s
* Make features, etc.

Using Drupal book (and website). Every chapter is a specific type of Drupal
deployment and there is an install profile for each.

* Maybe this is a maturity issue (features, profiles, etc. are in response to
  patterns emerging)
