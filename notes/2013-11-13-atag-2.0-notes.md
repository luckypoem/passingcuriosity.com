ATAG 2.0 divided into two parts:

- Part A covers the accessibility of the tool itself; and

- Part B covers the accessibility of the content generated with the tool.

Part A requires that:

- Tools follow applicable accessiblity guidelines. (A.1)

- Editing views must be perceivable, operable and understandable. (A.2-A.4)

These are met by following WCAG 2.0 or platform-specific guidelines for native
applications and:

- Ensuring that assistive technologies support the tool by providing
  alternative content and using correct APIs.

- Providing keyboard shortcuts, avoid timing and movement issues, etc.

- Help authors avoid, detect and correct mistakes and include documentation of
  all functionality.

That is:

- A.1 is about following accessibility specs.

- A.2 is about how tools "look"

- A.3 is about how users "navigate" tools

- A.4 is about how tools help and support users
