I want to buy some new hardware. Benchmarking generates tons of data 

Problem: Humans can't make sense of large numbers of numbers. This is not a
bug, it's a feature.

87.5% of statistics are made up on the spot.

Use them to prove anything. Including the truth.

Statistics are hard, lets go shopping. What numbers would you like to buy
today?

Not all data is the same
------------------------

Ask:

- What does the data represent?
- What information can be extracted from the data?

Can represent:

- baselines
- progressions
- comparative numbers
- etc.

Representation
--------------

- The representation is as important as the data. People evaluate the
  representation, not the data.
- Charts are good. Choosing the right chart is **important**.
- Not all representation should be charts. Some should be maps.
- Sometimes the right way is a simple table of data.

Tufte's books and monograph about MS PowerPoint.

Benchmarks
----------

Benchmarks - generate a single number to serve as a basis for comparison.

Operations people don't need benchmarks. We need detailed statistics and be
able to use them to make tradeoffs. Not everything can be reduced to a single
number.

The result of any benchmark is typically a curve which closely follows the
curve of `1-e^(-x)`.
