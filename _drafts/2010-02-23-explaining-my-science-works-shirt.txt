I love [xkcd][xkcd] and late last year I finally got around to ordering a few
of Randall's excellent t-shirts and posters. My favourite is [Science: it 
works, bitches][siwb]. On the front is the catchy slogan ("Science: it works
bitches", for those who're a bit slow on the uptake) and on the back is one of
the most compelling graphs in the history of science.
