A buggy implementation of the CSS box model and various departures from other standards are not the only issues to deal with when making a web site Internet Explorer-proof (never mind "idiot", IE is the web version of "intellectual cripple"). You also need to work around one of the worst implementations of JavaScript, DOM, and event handling every vomited upon innocent computers.

<script type="application/javascript">//<![CDATA[
	var fn = function(){
		window.alert('The situation is being handled');
	};

	$('input:radio').bind("change", fn);

	if ($.browser.msie) {
		$('input:radio').bind("click", fn);
	}
// ]]></script>
