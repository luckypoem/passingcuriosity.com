Using the "official" MySQL packages <http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#macosx-dmg> can cause problems on Mac OS X. In particular, the packages are only available for a single architecture while setuptools and the rest of the infrastructure expect libraries to support i386 and ppc architectures. When it comes time to link a compiled extension against such libraries, gcc errors out.

In short, install the x86 or ppc package and not the 64-bit versions unless you feel like recompiling Python, the packages you use, and all the libraries they link against.

Then the following should work:

<pre lang="sh">
# Create a new virtual environment
virtualenv --no-site-packages development
cd development
source bin/activate

# Install the "easy" stuff
easy_install django
easy_install M2Crypto

# Install Python Imaging Library
cd Imaging-1.1.6/
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
cd ..

# Install
cd MySQL-python-1.2.3c1/
ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386' python setup.py build
python setup.py install
cd ..
</pre>
