  I took a lot of notes at Edge of the Web 2009. This is an index to those
  articles.
---

I attended the second Edge of the Web conference in November this year. As I
often do when attending talks and such, I took pretty extensive notes -- I
very nearly transcribed most of the presentations I saw. I've listed all of
the articles I wrote about Edge of the Web 2009 below.

* [Anil Dash's keynote called Next Year's Web][ad]

  It's a bit presumptuous to say what the web will look like, so instead Anil
  tried to give us a framework to *decide* what it will look like next year.

* [Lachlan Hardy's session The Open Web][lh]

  Lachlan shared his definition of "the open web" as a philosophical point and
  then talked about a bunch of ways we can *be* "open web" right now, and how
  each of them are useful.

* [Dmitry Baranovskiy's talk on Your JavaScript Library][db]

  Dmitry discussed the reasons you might write a JavaScript library (or found
  that you've written one!) and some of the intricacies involved in doing it
  right.

* [Nick Cowie's talk on Progressive Enhancement with CSS3][nc]

  Nick took the audience through some background on CSS3 and progressive
  enhancement techniques and how he's used them on the State Library of
  Western Australia web site.

* [Kevin Yank's presentation on CSS Frameworks][ky]

  Rather than present yet another list of frameworks, Kevin tried to answer
  three questions: What does a CSS framework do for me? How do I choose a
  framework? and Are they pure evil?

* [Derek Powazek's closing keynote on the Wisdom of Community][dp]

  Derek gave us a guided tour through four of the most prominent types of
  "crazy" on community sites and ways that we can help deal with them.

* [Darcy Laycock and Matt Didcoe's talk about GeoAware websites][dlmd]

  Darcy and Matt gave a short introduction to the location APIs available in
  several web-browsers.

* [Justin Mclean's presentation on Connecting Hardware to the Web][jm]

  Justin demonstrated some of the options in connections hardware -- he used
  Arduinos -- to the web.

* [Alex Payne's talk called Mind the Tools][ap]

  Alex gave a historical overview of the programming languages used on the
  web. Based on this, he picked out some interesting trends and did a *little*
  bit of crystal ball gazing.
