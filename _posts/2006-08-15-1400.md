This is a test of the new <a href="http://beta.blogger.com/">Blogger Beta</a>. There are a few rough edges (literally &mdash; some of the "buttons" have jaggies as a result of dithering with the wrong background colour) and the AJAX would be nicer wall-to-wall, but I have no doubt that the Blogger team will clean up the various other bits and pieces in no time at all.
