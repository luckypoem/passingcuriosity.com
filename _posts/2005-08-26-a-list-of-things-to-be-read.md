There are a few topics that I'm interested in reading about, but haven't got any books on yet. This post will serve as a repository of these topics (so that I don't forget about any of them).<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521478170">Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories</a> is on category theory (<a href="http://thatlogicblog.blogspot.com/">Jon Cohen</a> recommended it to me)</li><li><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521804442">Sets for Mathematics</a> does sets (of which I have only an  informal understanding)</li></ul>More will be added as the need arises.
