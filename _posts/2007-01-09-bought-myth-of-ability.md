It's the 9th of January and I've already broken my main [new-year's resolution](/2007/resolution-for-2007-no-more-books/) by buying [the *Myth of Ability* by John Mighton](http://www.textpublishing.com.au/win-item.asp?id=288) which I saw for 25% off at [Angus & Robertson](http://www.angusrobertson.com.au).
