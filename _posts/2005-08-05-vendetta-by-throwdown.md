As I'm on a roll of posts about anime, books, blog-posts and the like, I've decided to branch out into music as well. My first post on music (this one) is a bit of a review of the album <a href="http://www.trustkill.com/webstore/music.php?id=725" style="font-style: italic;">Vendetta</a> by <a href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com.au/artists/Throwdown/">Throwdown</a> (released in Australia by <a href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com.au/">Road Runner Records</a>).<br /><br />It's a solid metal album, heavy on the guitars and drums, with powerful vocals. While it is good and will be going on my playlist, there isn't <span style="font-style: italic;">too</span> much, in my opinion, to differentiate it from the offerings of acts like <a href="http://www.killswitchengage.com/main.aspx">Killswitch Engage</a>, <a href="http://www.headcharge.com/">American Head Charge</a> (thought tend to be slightly more melodic) and <a href="http://www.fearfactory.com/">Fear Factory</a>.<br /><br />In short: kick-ass metal, but not <span style="font-style: italic;">too</span> inspired.
