By Clay...? (raised ~1.6M, then ~1.2M) and Richard Giles (raised 250K).

Talking about angel funding and venture capital for web projects and about Silicon Valley.

<strong>What level of equity do you have to give away?</strong> It depends largely on who's with the company? Good, well-known staff will let you keep more, but most people typically give 25-30%.

<strong>Needing lots of money, is it better to do it in rounds? Or go for the whole lot?</strong> Case by case. Clay, etc. got all 100K from directors on the basis of a small document, the business. Then developed for a while, then went looking for funding from well-off people on the basis of a 60min powerpoint talk. 20 meetings. Had a track record.

Richard Giles: Need a good business plan. <ol><li>Market research, other players, what they sold for, etc.</li><li>Cashflow projections, valuation, etc. from an accountant</li><li>Information memorandum that you can shoot off</li><li>Sitting down with potential investors...</li></ol>

Clay: Hesitate including too much in the way of projections (otherwise they'll be coming back wanting to know where the growth/profits/etc. is).

There was an awesome point about the US being about "How do we get bought by Google?" and the Australia about "How do we make money as a standalone company?". Also, someone mentioned that UK funding is for "sensible" projects, and US funding for "exciting" ones.
