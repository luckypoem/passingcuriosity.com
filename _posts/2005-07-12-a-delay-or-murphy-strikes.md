I've just had to take my iBook in to <a href="http://www.themacshop.com.au/">The Mac Shop</a> to get its charger (or perhaps the power regulation circuitry) fixed as it no longer wants to charge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this means that I'm unable to do any work for the next few days and may not get as much as I'd like done before my return to Canberra.
