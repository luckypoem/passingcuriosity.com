Rather than buy a few cookbooks, or a guide to leather-work or knitting, I usually hit the 'Net. For some reason, though, I often have difficulty finding recipes for really basic things. All too often, <a href="http://allrecipes.com/">All Recipes</a> won't have a simple no-frills recipe or, more often, will have dozens and dozens of variations. <br /><br />This is where sites like the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook">Wikibooks Cookbook</a> and <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/">Cooking for Engineers</a> can come in handy. Concise, clearly written instructions based on personal experience (although wikibooks, like all things wiki, can be a mess of contradictory information) with all the constraints so implied &mdash; they are simple, realistic and provide few, if any, endless variations on a particular theme.<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/internet">Internet</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/online">Online</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/cooking">Cooking</a><!--<br />--></span>
