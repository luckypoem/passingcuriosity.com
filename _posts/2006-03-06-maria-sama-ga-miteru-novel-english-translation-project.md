Some of my favourite anime and manga are based on Japanese novels which can be quite frustrating: anime and manga are accessible by dint of fan translation efforts, but translations of novels is pretty rare. That is why Geoff Zichterman's <a href="http://www.ziggr.com/mariasama/">Maria-sama ga Miteru Novel English Translation Project</a> is so awesome: he has managed (with assistance) to translate the entirety of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/514059/ref=amb_center-3_106850_2/249-8096671-5084306">first volume</a> of KONNO Oyuki's <span class="title">Maria-sama ga Miteru</span>.<br /><br />This has inspired me to make a somewhat belated new-years resolution: by the end of 2006 I hope to be able to read this book in Japanese.<br /><br /><a href="http://del.icio.us/url/39f9ace55cbb332f0e69a5a9b95879aa">Del.icio.us</a>
