[The Co-op Bookshop][1]

[1]: http://www.coop-bookshop.com.au/cgi-bin/fcgi-books?basket_name=1442763&user_id=1107303406949&_frames_=yes&use_template=true&_next_page_=NewParser&use_template=true&page=/html/contact_us.jhtml#TAS

One of the things that surprised me upon arriving in Canberra (about eleven
weeks ago now) is the Co-op. Here, it's open 9AM 'til 5PM, seven days a week.
In Launceston, it doesn't open 'til 5PM every weekday, or at all on weekends.
I think that they had a staffing problem this past year, but it is still
telling. That the bookshop is open seven days, and carries more than just the
set and recommended texts for the various courses, is threw me out.

I have a feeling I'll get used to it though: books, every day of the week.
