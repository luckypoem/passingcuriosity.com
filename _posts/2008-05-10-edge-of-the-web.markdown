Myles is talking about BarCamp2, it's an AWIA thingy, just like port80, barcamps, blog awards.

They've announced the <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/">Edge of the Web</a> web conference to be held on 6--7 November, 2008. I've signed up for the email list, and voted on the logo. Should be pretty good.
