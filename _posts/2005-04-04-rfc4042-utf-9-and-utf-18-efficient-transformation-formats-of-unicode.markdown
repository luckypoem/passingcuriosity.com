<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4042.txt">RFC4042:  UTF-9 and UTF-18 Efficient Transformation Formats of Unicode</a><br /><br />I can't tell if this is an April Fools RFC (the probable status) or a genuine proposal that has been misunderstood. It is certainly a far cry from the HTCPCP (Hyper-Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol) RFCs of yore. If nothing else, a nine-bit encoding is an interesting exercise.
