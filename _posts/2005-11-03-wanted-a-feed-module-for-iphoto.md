While <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> does a decent job of managing MP3 enclosures in news feeds (pod-casts), <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> could really do with similar functionality. I have my iBook randomly choose images from an album in my iPhoto library and it would be fantastic if I could get iPhoto to automatically download pictures from some of the fantastic sources on the 'net. Sites like <a href="http://www.ubcbotanicalgarden.org/potd/">Botany Photo of the Day</a> provide some amazing images.<br /><br />I'll see if I can figure out how to do this over the summer as my first piece of mac software.<hr/>I had a quick go at knocking this up with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/">Automator</a>, but it didn't work very well as I can't seem to get Safari to extract the image URLs from an XML feed and most interesting sites have a bunch of junk images as well (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, for example, has heaps and heaps of blank GIFs for spacing).
