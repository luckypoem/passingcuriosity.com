<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System.Console.GetOpt.html">System.Console.GetOpt</a> is a Haskell port of the GNU getopt library (which is almost impossible to find, unless they mean <span style="font-family: monospace;">getopt(3)</span> in glibc). In spite of being written in Haskell, the awfulness of <span style="font-family: monospace;">getopt</span> shines through.
