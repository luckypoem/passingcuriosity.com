<a href="http://deathjr.com/comic.html">Death, Jr.</a><br /><br />I've just read issue two of <span style="font-style: italic;">Death, Jr.</span> and it is even better than the first. Ted Naihef's art is brilliant; the contrast between Death (Jr.'s dad) and the rest of their suburban existence if wonderful.<br /><br />Run out and grab a copy now, you [probably] won't be disappointed.<br /><br />[Edit: Issue #2 got a fairly bad <a href="http://goodcomics.blogspot.com/2005/06/three-615-books-that-i-read-so-that.html">review</a> at <a href="http://goodcomics.blogspot.com/">Comics Should Be Good</a>. I agree with everything said there, but I still liked it.]
