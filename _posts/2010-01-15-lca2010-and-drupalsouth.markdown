I'm currently in Wellington, New Zealand for [linux.conf.au 2010][lca2010] and
then [DrupalSouth][drupalsouth]. It's going to be a pretty awesome week! I'm
looking forward to getting back up to speed with Linux which I've used only
superficially for the last few years after switching, on a lark, to FreeBSD
and then to Mac OS X.

If you're interested, you can see [LCA-specific archive][lca] (with an
[LCA-specific Atom feed][lca.atom]) or [Drupal-specific archive][drupal] (with
a [Drupal-specific Atom feed][drupal.atom]).
