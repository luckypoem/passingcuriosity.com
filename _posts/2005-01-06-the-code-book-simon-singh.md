[The Code Book](http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/books/default.aspx?id=19274&amp;subject=Fourth%20Estate) by [Simon Singh](http://www.simonsingh.net/)

A week or two ago, I finished reading Simon Singh's second book: *The Code
Book* and it is every bit as good as *Fermat's Last Theorem* was. Simon Singh
is, in my opinion and experience, one of the best popular science writers
around (though I still need to get a copy of *A Brief History of Time*). I'd
write more on the book but anything I could say, has already been said.

[Buy *The Code Book* from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography/dp/0385495323/).
