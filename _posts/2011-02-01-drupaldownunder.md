  Some thoughts and reactions to DrupalDownunder 2011 in Brisbane.
---

The weekend (and week) started poorly when my colleague who was also coming
(and had the travel and accommodation details!) was pulled off the plane
before take off at 12:30 AM. Apparently her ticket was from the morning
before, but none of the three or so Jetstar people who'd checked the boarding
pass at the gate and on the plane had noticed.

That said, landing in Brisbane, catching a taxi (picking up Dave from the
international airport on the way) and getting to the venue when smoothly. The
venue was a bit far out and the Internet access was pretty terrible, but the
facilities were very nice and the food was exceptional. The focus, though, is
on the content...

Saturday
========

My first session was [Simon Hobbs][sime] introducing the [Exportables][]
functionality from CTools. There was a bit of history (it grew out of
merlinofchaos' repeated implementations of these features in Views, etc.), a
bit of policy discussion (yet another dependency) and then some discussion
about actually using the API to export your own objects in a custom module.
This was a good introduction to a subject I'm interested to know more about.

For the second session everyone gathered in the main auditorium for the first
keynote session [Now you're in business: making a living with Drupal][alliekn]
by [Allie Micka][allie]. Allie discussed the *business* aspects of working
with Drupal: project management, clients, expectations, openness and
sustainability, business models and more. This was an good talk and very well
presented (though I found the animation in the slides a bit distracting), but
not a topic I'm terribly interested in.

[Dave Hall][skwashd]'s session [Building Distributions with Drupal
7][distributions] explained some of the changes to installation profile
support in Drupal 7 and the "features glued together by a profile" model of
distribution development. There was supposed to be a live demonstration, but
the flaky Internet access put paid to that. On the whole, it was an good talk
about an important subject.

After lunch (and the group photo) was [Josh Waihi][joshwaihi]'s keynote
[Goodbye Centralization, Hello Distribution: An Introduction to Git][joshwkn].
He provided an overview of git itself and some aspects of the Drupal.org
deployment and workflow. When the move to git is finished I imagine we'll see
a lot of the work currently going on at Github and other places moving back to
`drupal.org`.

Saturday finished with [Dries][dries]' keynote [Drupal: history, coummunity,
future][drieskn]. Having caught a redeye flight I was pretty much knackered by
this point, so I didn't catch much of this talk.
