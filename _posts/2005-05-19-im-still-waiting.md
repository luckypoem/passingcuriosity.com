I'm not sure what the hold-up is, but I am <span style="font-weight: bold;">still</span> waiting for my copy of <a href="http://troacss.blogspot.com/2005/04/books-glorious-books.html" style="font-style: italic;">Types and Programming Languages</a>. I do wish they'd hurry it up a little.<br /><br />In other, some what related (in the sense that is also involves an order), news I gave in to my primitive, lustful urges and ordered a 20-inch iMac.<br /><br />In even more, ..., news some of the books I've had on order came in today. I have in my hot little hands (read: hot little desk), <a href="http://www.onipress.com/graphicnovels/gn.php?id=121" style="font-style: italic;">Ojo</a> and <a href="http://www.onipress.com/graphicnovels/gn.php?id=11" style="font-style: italic;">Breakfast After Noon</a>.
