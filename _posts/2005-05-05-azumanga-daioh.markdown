I got the first volume of ADV Manga's translation of Azumanga Daioh today and, having just read about half of it, I much prefer  the scanlations to the licensed product. Why can't the American companies that buy the rights to translate anime and manga into English resist the urge to re-interpret the characters and their lines?

We buy anime and manga precisely because we want to read Japanese comics and watch Japanese animations. The horrible,  grating, little changes that ADV Manga made to make the book more palatable  to an American audience (i.e. to dumb it down)  mean that I'll not likely buy another book from ADV Manga. I'd rather buy books from Japan and download scanlations from the 'net than give my money to butchers...
