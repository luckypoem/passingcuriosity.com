<p>I want to really learn <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> so I've decided to start working on a project. Being interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elearning">online learning</a>, I'm going to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Learning_Environment">virtual learning environment</a>.</p>

<p>I'll need to read up on a bunch of things like standards (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCORM"><acronym title="Shareable Content Object Reference Model">SCORM</acronym></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMS_Learning_Design"><acronym title="IMS Learning Desgin">IMS LD</acronym></a>, and <a href="http://industry.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?page=1819">Becta's learning platform specifications</a>) and pedagogical approaches (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_%2528learning_theory%2529">constructivism</a>, etc.) before I can really get started, but I hope to have something useful going within two or three months.</p>
