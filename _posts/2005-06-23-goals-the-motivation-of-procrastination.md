So far, I have:<ul><li><a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/06/parsing-stuff-in-haskell.html">written a parser</a> for my logic definition language;</li><li><a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/06/polymorphism-and-generality-redux-or.html">solved</a> the <a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/06/polymorphism-and-generality.html">problem</a> I was having with polymorphism;</li><li><a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/06/data-structures.html">designed</a>, in the large, my data structures; and</li><li><a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/06/hello-ill-be-your-host-tonight-as-we.html">thought</a> about name for the project.</li></ul>We've now entered the mid-year holiday between the two semesters and I am hoping to get a large amount of my implementation done during the break. On my list of things to do are:<ul><li>define a state monad (to model the saturation of a branch);</li><li>define a backtracking monad (to model the branching of non-deterministic choices);</li><li>find a way to compose them (perhaps by <a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/06/polymorphism-and-generality-redux-or.html">deriving a monad transformer</a>);</li><li>finalise the structure of the logic modules;</li><li>write a realistic (perhaps even production) parser and code generator for the logics;</li><li>learn to use <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/"> hs-plugins</a> to write dynamically loadable modules (and find a way to make logic modules dynamically loadable); and</li><li>implement some representative test logics (propositional calculus, K, intuitionistic logic, something with transitive frames, etc).</li></ul>I've got a lot of work ahead of me, but the next few weeks are going to be fun. At the end of it, I will (I hope) have a running system to extend and improve and a much greater knowledge of Haskell.
