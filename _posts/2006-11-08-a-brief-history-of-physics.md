<p>Aristotle was perhaps the first in the Western tradition to
look at mechanics in any sort of structured way. A philosopher,
rather than physicist, Aristotle thought about the way objects
interact with each other, particularly their motions.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>One of the ideas to come from Aristotle's work is that objects
"like" to remain at rest. This seems rather reasonable &mdash;
put a book on a table and it remains still, push it gently and it
will move until you stop. This begs the question, though &mdash;

what happens when we throw ad object? Our hand stops pushing, but
the object continues to move. Likewise when we roll a ball
&mdash; we release the ball and it continues to move. Aristotle's
answer was impetus.</p>

<p>When an object is moved by another (your hand, for example,
throwing a ball), it accrues impetus. When the mover stops acting
upon the movee, the impetus it accrued whilst being acted upon is
used to continue the motion. Under this model, we would expect
objects to exhibit straight-line trajectories (see 
<a href="#hist-fig-1">figure one</a>) rather than the parabolic
trajectories (see <a href="#hist-fig-2">figure two</a>) we see
when we throw an object.</p>

<p>A second idea of Aristotle's is that heavier objects fall
faster than lighter objects. It does, at first glance, seem
rather reasonable but it is, like the idea of impetus, quite
easily shown incorrect.</p>

<p>The Aristotleans didn't bother to take observations or do
experiments to support their beliefs and most of those that came
after them were content to trust Aristotle. Thus for more than
100 years, our understanding of mechanics was fundamentally
flawed. It is the resolution of this flaw that brings the next
major milestone in mechanics: experimentation.</p>

<p>During the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries,
Galileo Galilei and other became amongst the first physicists
when they used experimentation to confirm and reject their ideas
about the motion of objects. Among Galileo's more famous
experiments (though the story is now considered to be untrue) is
his dropping balls of varing mass of the Leaning Tower of Pisa by
which he showed that, contrary to Aristotle's account, the speed
of a falling object is independant of its mass. It is precisely
this power &mdash; to overturn wrong ideas, even if though they
have been believed true for centuries, and to suggest a more
complete understanding &mdash; that makes experimentation so
central to all of the sciences.</p>

<p>This experimental focus was not the last development in the
physics that we'll be looking at, though it did help pave the way
for it. This next and final (for our purposes) leap was due to 
Newton &mdash; using mathematics to describe physics. After that,
classical mechanics was essentially complete, with "only" quite a
few decades of improvements and polishing before the introduction
of relativity and quantum mechanics. It is physics at this level,
the state of the art of classical mechanics circa the mid
19<sup>th</sup> century, that we'll be studying in this
course.</p>
