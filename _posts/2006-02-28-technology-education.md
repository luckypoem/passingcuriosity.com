<a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/units/ESA184">ESA184 - Technology Education (Single)</a><br /><br />In the next few days (i.e: before Thursday), I need to decide on a technology module to do this semester. The co-ordinator told us this morning that there are six choices:<ul><li>principals of design;</li><li>design in wood; and</li><li>food technology</li></ul> run concurrently in the morning, and <ul><li>textiles;</li><li>hard materials design; and</li><li>computer aided design;</li></ul> run concurrently in the afternoon class. <br /><br />I'll probably do <acronym title="Computer Aided Design">C.A.D.</acronym> (what with my other specialisation being <acronym title="Infomation and Communication Technology">ICT</acronym> and all).
