Watched <a class="title" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0079574/">Moonraker</a> again last night. Was surprised at how repulsive I found Mr. Bond. Perhaps shouldn't have been. I much prefer <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000112/">Pierce Brosnan's</a> Bond; if nothing else he doesn't come over as such an arrogant cad.<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/watching">Watching</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/films">Films</a> </span>
