As I've mentioned a few times, I'm hoping to work on some materials for computer science education this semester. The gist of my current plans is a core of basic computer science material (very basic data structures and algorithms) backed up by a range of individual and small group projects. I hope to provide a wide enough range of projects to ensure that most students will find something engaging enough that they learn (even in spite of their wanting only to use the Internet).<br /><br />I'm currently anticipate designing projects using some, if not all, of the following pieces of software: <!--<br /><br />--><dl><!--<br />    --><dt><a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskore/">Haskore</a></dt><!--<br />    --><dd>A computer music system based on Haskell.</dd><!--<br />    --><dt><a href="http://haskell.org/pan/">Pan</a> (or Pan# or one of the several variations on the theme)</dt><!--<br />    --><dd>A functional graphical processing language similar to Haskell.</dd><!--<br />    --><dt><a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/pivotal/">Pivotal</a></dt><!--<br />    --><dd>A document centred presentation of Haskell.</dd><!--<br />    --><dt><a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/cr3/toolbox/haskell/FunWorlds/">FunWorlds</a></dt><!--<br />    --><dd>An interactive 3D animation package in, you guessed it, Haskell.</dd><!--<br />--></dl><!--<br /><br />-->You may have noticed a trend in the projects above: they all use, or are closely related to, the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell programming language</a>. This is for a number of reasons: <!--<br /><br />--><ol><!--<br />    --><li>I like functional programming, in general, and Haskell, in particular.</li><!--<br />    --><li>I don't like the languages usually taught to students (Java, VisualBasic, etc.)</li><!--<br />    --><li>I think that a different, more fundamental, approach might help (supported, I think, by the experiences of teachers using SICP in high schools in the U.S.).</li><!--<br />--></ol><!--<br /><br />-->We'll see how things pan out. If possible, I'd like to integrate some of the above packages into a single whole. <acronym>Haskore</acronym> and one of the portable Haskell variants of <acronym>Pan</acronym>, for example, might be integrated with <acronym>Pivotal</acronym> to give a relatively simple environment for interactive, multi-media <acronym>Haskell</acronym> programming. <acronym>Haskore</acronym>, in particular, could benefit extraordinarily from such an integration: the student be able to "code", visualise and listen to their musical compositions from the same program.<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/teaching">Teaching</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/programming">Programming</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/projects">Projects</a></span>
