Today I took my first CAD lesson as teacher. I'd intended for the students to use this first lesson to being the self-paced tutorials for <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</a>, the program we'll be using. Rather than <emph>start</emph> the tutorials, most of the class had them <emph>finished</emph> half way through the lesson. <br /><br />As a stop gap, I drew some simple figures on the board (just a few basic roof, door and window shapes) for the ones who finished earlier than I was expecting to complete and asked the students that finished even those to model items from around the class room. The main thing that I got out of this lesson is the need to have extension work planned and ready to go &mdash; making up extension problems one at a time doesn't work nearly so well when it's the whole class.<br /><br />Feed back from my colleague teachers includes the need for me work on getting and maintaining the students' attention (e.g. when giving instruction) as I have a tendancy to try to talk over the top of them which doesn't work very well as a) I'm not loud enough, and b) they listening. I also need to make sure that I keep them on task.<br /><br /><span class="note">This post was written ex post facto.</span><br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/pe2">PE2</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/education">Education</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/practicum">Practicum</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/teaching">Teaching</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/computer">Computer</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/graphics">Graphics</a> / <!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/cad">CAD</a><!--<br />--></span>
