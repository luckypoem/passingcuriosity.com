After a bit of cleaning up (it was caked with grease and grime) it's presented as being even more curious.<br /><br />It is constructed of four wooden segments of equal length joined with what I assume to be brass pins and hinges. Both sides bear scales. The inside face has a single scale on the lower edge with inches and sixteenths marked. The outside face bears an inch scale marked on both edges and three different sub-inch scales: the bottom edge is marked in inches and eighths, the first seventeen inches of the top edge are marked inches and twelfths, the last seventeen inches of the top edge are marked in inches and tenths, and the middle two inches of the top edge are unmarked as the hinge makes them unusable as a line or measure.<br /><br />The ruler has a number of markings in addition to the scales marked: each of the sub inch scales are labelled with the appropriate number, and each face bears a "3FT" before the brass end cap. The outside face bears what may be some manufacturers marks between the thirteen and sixteen inch marks. While they are too faint to make out with any degree of certainty, the first appears to be a rectangular border containing an entirely illegible first line and a second line: "LUCAS". The second might be "made in England" but is even fainter than the first and only "and" may be made out reliably. The third mark is quite easily made out and reads "354".<br /><br />I had a bit of a poke around on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> and did a bit of <a href="http://www.google.com/">Googling</a>, but haven't been able to find out much. Any information would be appreciated.<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/picture">Picture</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/curious">Curious</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/object">Object</a></span>
