<h3>The Questions</h3>

<strong>Why has the lightbox on the web-site stopped working?</strong>

<strong>Why have the Y generation (or maybe a bit newer) not moved from IM to twitter?</strong> Twitter is still in the alpha geek stage, and we alpha geeks tend to live in a bit of a coocoon. Not everyone in the world spends 24/7 online learning about new tech (and tweeting).

<strong>When Twitter goes mainstream, do we all leave?</strong> Yes. Remember ICQ? Take-up,
by geeks, tail, etc. (From the audience: "My Mum has a lower ICQ number than me.")

<strong>CSS drop-down, works in Firefox, but not IE. Why?</strong> <code>:hover</code> on non-a.

<strong>GPL making software sales redundant?</strong> The people who use OSS are alpha geeks. Being able to buy it, buy support, etc. It's not a silver bullet or a panacea by any stretch of the imagination.

<strong>Do you think that distributed version control is going to kill centralised?</strong> No. Decentralisation bad (in most people's circumstances).

<strong>Is IE going to keep it's huge market share?</strong> Probably. Inertia, status quo, don't care, etc.

<strong>Do you have a favourite Australian tech podcast?</strong> I don't listen to podcasts. I want to get the information and leave.

<strong>Am I lazy using prototype for my AJAX?</strong> No. Absolutely not. So long as you understand what it's doing, using frameworks is great.

<strong>I just got here and I've got no idea what Edge of the Web is</strong> The AWIA web conference announced today?

<strong>What do you think about developing from a platform, rather than from first principals?</strong> They're different. Different audiences (S3 is a remote platform, App Engine is a cloud, OpenSocial has a specific purpose).

<strong>Lets say a client comes to you and asks you to build something; how do you estimate how long/much it'll take?</strong> This is a problem that's been haunting the software community basically forever. It basically boils down to experience. Breaking it down into components helps estimate effectively and gives slack, etc.
