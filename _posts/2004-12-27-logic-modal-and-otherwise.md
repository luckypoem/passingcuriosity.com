Attending the [Logic Summer School][1] at the Australian National University has encouraged me to continue my studies of formal logic begun with the unit [HPA292: Logic and Philosophy][2]> more informally on my own.

To this end, I purchased the Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science
book [Modal Logic][3]. My initial impressions are favourable, though I've not
read much of the book.

I'll expound here in further detail on the merits of this book at a later
time.
