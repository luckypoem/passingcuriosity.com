A while back, I bought a novel on impulse (it was cheap). To my surprise (and delight) it turned out to be the first space opera I've bought that was actually good. If you're looking for an interesting story, with an intriguing cast of characters, then I'd highly recommend <a span="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.orbitbooks.co.uk/orbit/display.asp?K=183580363938222">Trading in Danger</a> by Elizabeth Moon.<br /><hr/>Another recent find (this time of the on-line variety) is a science fiction story called "The Outers" by "The Angst Guy". Though it is a piece of fan fiction (based on the only good thing MTV has brought to the world <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daria">Daria</a>), <a span="font-style:italic;" href="http://www.outpost-daria.com/fanfic_series_outers.html">The Outers</a> is an enthralling read. Perhaps its only fault is that it The Angst Guy is not continuing it (or not currently, at least).
