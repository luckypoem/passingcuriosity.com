I saw a little display in <a href="http://birchalls.com.au/">Birchall's</a> today advertising the imminent release of Katherine Kerr's latest book <span class="title">Gold Falcon</span> <a href="http://www.deverry.com/goldexcp.html">(excerpt)</a>. This is very, very good news &mdash; if they're sending posters out to bookshops, then it's all but certain to actually ship!
