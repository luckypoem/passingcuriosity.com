It's been quite a while since last I posted (here, or anywhere else), so I think it's about time for an update. Things are going adequately on the school front &mdash; it was a little touch and go, but I managed not to fail anything last semester &mdash; and I'm about to start a support job with a research project which will bring a welcome injection of funds (which have been rather tight lately).<br /><br />On the "reading" front, I purchased my copy of <a class="title" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/attapl/index.html" title="Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages, Benjamin Pierce (ed.)">Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages</a> (companion and somewhat successor to <a class="title" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/index.html"><acronym title="Types and Programming Languages, Benjamin Pierce">TAPL</acronym></a>) this morning. I've had a bit of a flick through it and it looks really, <emph>really</emph> interesting. Hopefully having spent almost $200 on the two books will provide an added incentive to not only start, but finish, reading them and hopefully even work through the problems.<br /><br />I've been thinking about typography and book design lately which has suggested, amongst other things, that I see if it'd be possible to get my copy of <acronym class="title">ATTAPL</acronym> rebound with some extra pages. It would be nice, for example, to insert the extended version of <a class="title" href="http://cristal.inria.fr/attapl/">chapter 10 - the essence of ML type inference</a> and to "fix" any errata with updated pages. I imagine, though I haven't bothered to investigate at all, that this'd be quite a difficult and expensive thing to do for a single copy, so it'll probably be a long while before I do it, if ever.<br /><br />Before that though, I've been focussed on getting through <a class="title" href="http://consequently.org/logic/">Logic</a> by <a href="http://consequently.org/">Greg Restall</a>. I'm almost half way through and while I'd have preferred a slightly difference syntax (I prefer <code>&and;</code> as conjunction, rather than <code>&amp;</code>), it's easy to read and is much more accessible than most other books I've seen with titles like "<span class="title">Logic</span>."<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/books">Books</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/tapl">TAPL</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/attapl">ATTAPL</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/logic">Logic</a></span>
