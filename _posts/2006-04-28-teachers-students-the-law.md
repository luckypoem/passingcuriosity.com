I've just finished reading <a class="title" href="http://www.victorialaw.org.au/books/teachers_students_and_the_law.htm">Teachers, students & the law</a> by Andrew Hopkins (published by the Victoria Law Foundation). It covers a number of legal issues important to teachers and school staff including the duty of care, mandatory reporting of abuse and rights and responsibilities. <br /><br />The thing that really surprised me in reading this book is that corporal punishment may be permitted in schools in the Northern Territory and non-government schools in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. I wonder when these states will catch up with the rest and abolish corporal punishment in schools altogether...<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/education">Education</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/law">Law</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/books">Books</a> </span>
