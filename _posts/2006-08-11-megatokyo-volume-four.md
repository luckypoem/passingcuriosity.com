It's good to see another Megatokyo book out and it's fantastic that it took so long to come in (having sold out, etc.). <br /><br />The presentation is essentially the same as the first three volumes by <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/">Dark Horse</a>. The only shortcoming I can see in the book is the binding &mdash; for some reason <a href="http://www.cmxmanga.com/">CMX</a> couldn't manage to glue the pages level. It's no worse than the last book from Dark Horse and it <emph>is</emph> a fairly minor flaw, but it would have been nice if they'd put that little bit extra into the book's construction.<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/books">Books</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/manga">Manga</a><!--<br />--></span>
