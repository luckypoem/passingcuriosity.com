title   : Converting to Jekyll
excerpt : |
  This blog has been languishing for months now, nearly
  untouched. I'm changing that now, by throwing WordPress away and
  replacing it with Jekyll.

I've been running neglected, unread blogs for a while now. Initially, I was
using [Blogger][1] to post news for a club at university. Later I blogged
notes about a research project, my honours topic, and assorted other stuff I
was doing. When I started studying education, I started another blog about 
it. Eventually, I bought a domain, signed up for hosting, installed
[Wordpress][2] and imported all those old posts. Now, it's time for the next
step.

Over the five years since I started my first blog, I've written less. Fewer
posts, fewer words, lower quality.
