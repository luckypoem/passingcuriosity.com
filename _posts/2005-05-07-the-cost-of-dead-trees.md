I've just been reading a bit of <acronym style="font-style: italic;" title="Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming by Van Roy and Haridi">CTM</acronym>. As I often do, I've used the receipt as a book mark (primarily because the bookshop staff put the receipt in the book when I ask them not to put my purchases in a bag).<br /><br />CTM cost me, after the Co-op members discount, $97. The <span style="font-style: italic;" title="Haskell 98 Language and Libraries; The Revised Report edited by Simon Peyton Jones">Revised Haskell 98 Report</span> cost me $108. I'm sure there is some obtuse economic explanation involving economies of scale and the like, but it seems fairly counter intuitive that a book that is over 900 pages long is cheaper than one with less than 300.<br /><br />The cost of books in general, and academic texts in particular, is (in my opinion) revolting.
