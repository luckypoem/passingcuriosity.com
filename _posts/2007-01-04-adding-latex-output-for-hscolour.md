My patch adding [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) output to
[HsColour](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/darcs/hscolour) (a syntax highlighter
for the [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/) programming language) was accepted
into the main darcs repository. There was a previous post [announcing the
patch](/2006/hscolour-is-syntax-highlighter-for/).
