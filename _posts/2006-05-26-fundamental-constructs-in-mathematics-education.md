John Mason and Sue Johnston-Wilder (<emph>Eds.</emph>). (<a href="http://isbn.nu/0415326982">buy</a>)<br /><br />After an introduction to the beingness of the thinghood of constructs (named, described phenomena as far as I can tell), this book launches straight into extracts describing some of the most important and influential experiments in mathematics education. I've read the first chapter which describes a number of experiments that have been used to investigate the way children learn mathematical concepts. So far it has been a good deal more readable than I was expecting.<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/mathematics">Mathematics</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/education">Education</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/books">Books</a></span>
