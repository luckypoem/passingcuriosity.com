Cue Sawzall, a new language that Google use to write distributed, parallel data-processing programs for use on their clusters. While the language isn't particularly attractive (I've never liked C-style syntax's), the approach is very interesting and the implementation issues they describe are enlightening.<br /><br /><a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/916">LtU</a> | <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/article/227597">CiteULike</a> | <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/948265aed2dcc94467755d7e6d932de5">Del.icio.us</a>
