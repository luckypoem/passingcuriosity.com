Today was the third day of <acronym>Professional Experience One</acronym> and the other shoe dropped. Continuing with the material I've planned, the first class ripped along, even those who were absent yesterday and needed to catchup. <br /><br />The second class was another matter entirely. A number of them managed to finish everything and I was <emph>really</emph> happy with three or four of them in that we've managed to resolve their initial confusions and get them to the point where they are completing problems quicker than 90% of the class. Other students in this class managed to avoid completing much at all, even when I was stood next to them trying to find out if they needed assistance or were just being lazy. Some of this is to be expected (they were distracted by an event being held after my class), but I'm not sure how I'll be able to get through to them if they're like this tomorrow.<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong>  <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/education">Education</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/teaching">Teaching</a> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/practicum">Practicum</a></span>
