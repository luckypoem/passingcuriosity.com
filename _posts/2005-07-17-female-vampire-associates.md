I'm not sure how recent a development it is, but there certainly seem to be a fair (and growing) number of books out there with female main characters who "associate" with vampires and the supernatural. Laurell K. Hamilton's <span style="font-style: italic;">Anita Blake</span>, Tanya Huff's <span style="font-style: italic;">Vicki Nelson</span>, Kelley Armstrong's <span style="font-style: italic;">Paige Winterbourne</span>, Charlaine Harris' <span style="font-style: italic;">Sookie Stackhouse</span>, the list goes on (though I can't think of any more off hand).<br /><br />This type of book focuses on a female main character who is dragged into (or perhaps is already a part of) the seedy underworld of the supernatural. Some of these books (the <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.orbitbooks.co.uk/orbit/results.asp?AUB=Laurell%20K%20Hamilton&TAG=&CID=orbit">Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter</a> series for example) have a gritty, realistic edge to them: the more or less human characters are caught up in a whirlwind of violence and death managing to survive only by chance, by the sufferance of monsters, or (by the skin of their teeth) by their own abilities.<br /><br />Others of this genre (the <a href="http://www.orbitbooks.co.uk/orbit/results.asp?AUB=Charlaine%20Harris&TAG=&CID=orbit" style="font-style: italic;">Sookie Stackhouse Vampire Mysteries</a> for example) sport a softer, less harshly-realistic look at the denizens of the night and their associates. Sporting just as many fatalities, these books offer a lighter, more accessible and more palatable read.<br /><br />I've only read the first two <span style="font-style: italic;">Sookie Stackhouse</span> books, but I found them more enjoyable, if slightly less intense, than the <span style="font-style: italic;">Anita Blake</span> books. If you like the Hamilton, Huff or Armstrong's books, you'll probably enjoy Charlaine Harris' <span style="font-style: italic;">Sookie Stackhouse Vampire Mysteries</span>.
