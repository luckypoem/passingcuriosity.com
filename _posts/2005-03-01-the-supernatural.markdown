It was good, but I can remember lowering the book (to change position as I switch sides quite frequently when I read lying down) and thinking "There isn't much time left to wrap up the mystery." I seem to recall thinking something like that while reading a number of these books. It doesn't detract from them, indeed the frantic pace of the last couple of chapters lends them something that some other books don't have.<br /><br />I had intended to get the latest book in the series (<a href="http://www.orbitbooks.co.uk/orbit/display.asp?isb=1841493163&TAG=BWC9CX5X7X9977X91T6HVD&CID=orbit">Incubus Dreams</a>) today, but I became engrossed reading some more of the Handbook chapter I wrote about yesterday and missed closing time. I'll just have to get it tomorrow (or rather, today).<br /><br />A while ago (probably sometime in November) I got <span style="font-style: italic;">Industrial Magic</span> by <span style="font-style: italic;">Kelley Armstrong</span> on a whim. For some reason I like these sorts of books now. Maybe it is that they tend to be more mature than the genre fantasy I have read almost to the exclusion of all else 'til now. That they are similar is obvious (even the <a href="http://www.orbitbooks.co.uk/orbit/armstrong-kelley.asp?TAG=BWC9CX5X7X9977X91T6HVD&CID=orbit#backlisttitles">publisher's website</a> agrees with me), but I'm fairly sure I'm not in their target demographic. For some reason the realistic, gritty nature of these books involving the supernatural (even film media like <a href="http://www.channel4.co.uk/">Channel 4</a>'s <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-4940/" style="font-style: italic;">Ultraviolet</a>) is attractive to me right now.<br /><br />I'd appreciate any suggestions of more books similar to those above.
