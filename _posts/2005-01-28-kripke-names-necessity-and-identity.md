[Kripke: Names, necessity, and identity][1]

This sounds like an interesting book. I'll have to see if I can get a hold of
it some how, as I don't really want to spend $130 on a book without at least
looking at it first. On the other hand, if I spend $130 on a book, perhaps
I'll bother to read it which will be an improvement.

Normally I buy books, and put them on my bookshelf, occasionally after having
read a chapter or two.
