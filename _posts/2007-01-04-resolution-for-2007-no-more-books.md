title: "Resolution for 2007: no more books!"

One of my resolutions for 2007 is to beat my book buying habit. Too often I find myself buying a new book, reading the first few chapters, and abandoning it in favour of another new purchase. I have a deck of playing cards which I used a bookmarks and almost all of them are in books, some of which I began reading more than two years ago. I therefore resolve not to buy another book (excepting required textbooks) until I've finished those I already own. To start with, I've selected twelve shorter unread books:

<ul>
    <li> Thomas Paine, <emph class="title">Common Sense</emph></li>
    <li> Thorstein Veblen, <emph class="title">Conspicuous Consumption</emph></li>
    <li> Marcus Aurelius, <emph class="title">Meditations</emph></li>
    <li> Harry Brighouse, <emph class="title">Justice</emph></li>
    <li> Alastair Hannay, <emph class="title">On The Public</emph></li>
    <li> Lynne Truss, <emph class="title">Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</emph></li>
    <li> Jonathan Mills (ed.), <emph class="title">Barons to Bloggers: Confronting Media Power</emph></li>
    <li> Alain de Botton, <emph class="title">The Consolations of Philosophy</emph></li>
    <li> Chris George, <emph class="title">The Book of Digital Photography</emph></li>
    <li> Karen Cheng, <emph class="title">Designing Type</emph></li>
    <li> Gordon Rennie, David Bishop, Simon Jowett, Peter Evans &amp; James Swallow, <emph class="title">I Am the Law</emph></li>
    <li> Thomas Hardy, <emph class="title">Tess of the d'Urbervilles</emph></li>
</ul>
