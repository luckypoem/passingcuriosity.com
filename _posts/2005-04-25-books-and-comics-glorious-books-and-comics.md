I've just got back from Tasmania (visiting my family and friends). With me, I've bought the rest of my comics collection. The first 18 volumes of <span style="font-style: italic;">Lone Wolf and Cub</span> have certainly helped fill up my book case. When you throw in the rest of my books (novels, texts, references and popular sciences) and my CD and DVD collection, I need more shelf space. The only problem is that there is nowhere to put a book case. I suppose I'll just have to make do.<br /><br />Returning to comics, I've just added 6 books to my list of things to order, which is both good ("New comics. Yay!") and bad ("Where did that $100 go?!?"). Most of them are books by <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Andi Watson</span>. Looks like I'll soon have all of Watson's releases, or at least the trade paperbacks of them.<br /><br />On the books front, <span style="font-style: italic;">CTM</span> (or more completely: <span style="font-style: italic;">Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming</span> by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi) has come in. I'm going to pick it up tomorrow, but it'll be a while before I can start reading it (what with the million and one things I have to do in the next week or so).
