I've just been looking for material on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow">The Shadow</a>. I've managed to find a fan <a href="http://bimpco.tripod.com/novelization.html">novelisation</a> of the 1994 film staring Alec Baldwin which looks promising and I already have a copy Dark Horse's book featuring <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/news/pressrelease.php?id=271"> The Ghost and The Shadow</a>. I'm going to try and find the film on DVD as it was absolutely fantastic and I much prefer it to the original mythos (what I know of it).
