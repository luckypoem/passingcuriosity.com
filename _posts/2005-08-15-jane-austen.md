I've just started reading <span style="font-style: italic;">Mansfield Park</span> by Jane Austen. I got an etext from the <a href="http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/">eBooks@Adelaide</a> collection of free web books at the University of Adelaide Library.<br /><br />It's a great resource for anyone interested in the classics (I've put their editions of Austen's and the Bronte? sisters' books on my to-read queue).
