I shall have a go using the washing machine and tumble drier, but the thought has occurred to me that perhaps the wool was treated to prevent felting?<br /><br />In any case, I'll give it a go and if it doesn't work, I'll just use my knitting as knitting (instead of felt).<br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/felt">Felt</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/knitting">Knitting</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/wool">Wool</a><!--<br />--></span>
