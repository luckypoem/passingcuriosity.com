Whilst I appreciate and, I hope, understand the pedagogical value of using
"practical" examples to offer motivation for topics that can, like modal
logic, seem purely theoretical, I am beginning to appreciating just how
interesting, versatile and useful a field modal logic really is by looking at
it from a more theoretical and general point of view. The first twenty-four
pages of [*Modal Logic* (Blackburn, de Rijke and Venema)][1]) have impressed
upon me more readily and immediately than umpteen different modally
interpreted implication operators or logics of time did, the flexibility of
the modal semantics that I was taught in *Philosophy and Logic*.

That is not to say, however, that the more theoretical approach is better or
more suitable than teaching "by example". In a course without prerequisites in
mathematical reasoning, teaching modal logic by focusing on examples of its
use is the most obvious, and quite probably the best, course. Without the
opportunity to study modal logic in such a course, it would probably not have
caught my attention and I would be in no position to be reading this book.
