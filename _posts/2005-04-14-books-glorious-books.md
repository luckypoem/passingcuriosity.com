One field of Computer Science I am particularly interested in is programming languages. In a probably futile attempt to speed my learning in this area, I ordered a few books from <a href="http://www.coop-bookshop.com.au/">The Coop Bookshop</a> the other day. I chose the books based on the various recommendation on the <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a> weblog forums (adjusted by price, availability, and recency of publishing).<br /><br />After a bit of um-ing and ah-ing, I finally settled on Benjamin Pierce's <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/" style="font-style: italic;">Types and Programming Languages</a>, Peter Seibel's <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/" style="font-style: italic;">Practical Common Lisp</a> and <a href="http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/people/PVR/book.html" style="font-style: italic;">Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming</a> by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi.<br /><br />That's a bit of $300-worth of books, so I hope to get around to reading them at some point between when they arrive (somewhere between a week and a month away, I imagine) and the end of the year.<br /><br />Suggestions of other books suitable for beginners in the areas of type systems, programming language theory, and related fields are most welcome in the comments.
