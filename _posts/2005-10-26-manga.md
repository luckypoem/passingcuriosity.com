I've recently (i.e. since my last post on manga) purchased a whole bunch of new manga books. Today I got <span class="title">The One I Love</span> by CLAMP (Tokyopop's translation of <span class="title">&#12431;&#12383;&#12375; &#12398; &#12377;&#12365;&#12394;&#12402;&#12392;</span>), which is a great little book.<br /><br />I've also got a whole bunch of Viz Media books including <span class="title">Koko wa Greenwood</span> (or <span class="title">Here is Greenwood</span> in English), <span class="title">Maison Ikkoku</span> books 1-5 (with 6-10 on order) and <span class="title">Hanazakari no Kimitachi e</span> (Viz, and everyone else, call it <span class="title">Hana-Kimi</span>).<br /><br />I've bought so many books whilst here in Canberra that I'm going to have to get them shipped when I leave (as opposed to taking them as checked luggage on my flight home).<br /><br />It seems that Western comics in the manga style are becoming popular. So much so that Tokyopop are publishing an Australian artist's book! I can't wait to see if <a href="http://tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?propertycode=DRM&categorycode=BMG" class="title">The Dreaming</a> is as good as it looks.<br /><br />PS: The Japanese input mode on Emacs (which I used to type the hiragana above) is shit-hot. Much easier than trying to use the Japanese Kana Palette or any other input method I've tried.
