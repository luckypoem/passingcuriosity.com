I've just been to the comic shop spending the money I should be saving for
kitchenware and next weeks food (I'll have to cook my own meals after I move
into B&G tomorrow). I got *[Dead@17: The Complete First Series][dead@17]*,
*[Aria Volume One][aria]* and *[Remote Volume One][remote]*

[aria]: http://www.advfilms.com/CatalogManga_Detail.asp?Vol=10056&Title=ARIA
[remote]: http://www.tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?page=product&productid=2057

I got *Aria* as the cover art reminded me a little of *Yokohama Kaidashi
Kikou* ([English Scanlation][ykkscan]) as did the cover text. I've not read it
yet, but a quick flick through has made me want to go back (though the shop'll
be closed now) and buy the other two volumes although, now that I think about
it, they only had the third on the shelf. If this book turns out to be
anywhere near as good as *YKK*, I'll have to try an get some more of his work.

I haven't read *Remote* yet, but I chose it due primarily to the cover text
and the colour section at the front (though a quick flick through the book
cemented the decision). I usually like detective and police related anime and
manga (series such as *Spiral*, *Saint Tail* and the various *Patlabor* films,
books and series come to mind) so I don't think this is much of a gamble.

I have just finished reading *Dead@17* and it has once again reminded me that
the Japanese do not have a monopoly on great comics. I'm definitely going to
be getting the rest of *Dead@17* and sooner rather than later.

It looks like Impact are going to be getting hold of a large chunk of my
disposable income in the immediate future.
