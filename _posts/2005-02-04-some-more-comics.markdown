I posted the following on <a href="http://interestingexperience.blogspot.com/">one of my other blogs</a>:<br /><blockquote><a href="http://vipercomics.com/shop/book_dead_tpb.asp">Viper Comics: Dead@17: The Complete First Series</a><br /><a href="http://www.advfilms.com/CatalogManga_Detail.asp?Vol=10056&Title=ARIA">Aria Volume One</a><br /><a href="http://www.tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?page=product&productid=2057">Remote Volume One</a><br /></blockquote><br />I've just been to the comic shop spending the money I should be saving for kitchenware and next weeks food (I'll have to cook my own meals after I move into B&G tomorrow). I got <span style="font-style: italic;">Dead@17</span>: The Complete First Series, <span style="font-style: italic;">Aria</span> Volume One and <span style="font-style: italic;">Remote</span> Volume One.<br /><br />I got <span style="font-style: italic;">Aria</span> as the cover art reminded me a little of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou</span> (<a href="http://ykk.misago.org/" title="English Scanlation">English Scanlation</a>) as did the cover text. I've not read it yet, but a quick flick through has made me want to go back (though the shop'll be closed now) and buy the other two volumes although, now that I think about it, they only had the third on the shelf. If this book turns out to be anywhere near as good as <span style="font-style: italic;">YKK</span>, I'll have to try an get some more of his work.<br /><br />I haven't read <span style="font-style: italic;">Remote</span> yet, but I chose it due primarily to the cover text and the colour section at the front (though a quick flick through the book cemented the decision). I usually like detective and police related anime and manga (series such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Spiral</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Saint Tail</span> and the various <span style="font-style: italic;">Patlabor</span> films, books and series come to mind) so I don't think this is much of a gamble.<br /><br />I have just finished reading <span style="font-style: italic;">Dead@17</span> and it has once again reminded me that the Japanese do not have a monopoly on great comics. I'm definitely going to be getting the rest of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dead@17</span> and sooner rather than later.<br /><br />It looks like Impact are going to be getting hold of a large chunk of my disposable income in the immediate future.
