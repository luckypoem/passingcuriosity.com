<a href="http://www.voyageronline.com.au/books/title.cfm?ISBN=0732273927&Author=18" style="font-style: italic">The Gene of Isis</a> by <a href="http://www.voyageronline.com.au/traciharding/">Traci Harding</a>, published by <a href="http://www.voyageronline.com.au/">Voyager</a><br /><br />I've just started reading Traci Harding's latest book: <span style="font-style: italic">The Gene of Isis</span> and it looks like it'll be another great read. While I loved <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ancient Future Trilogy</span> and <a href="http://www.voyageronline.com.au/books/title.cfm?ISBN=0732266726&Author=18" style="font-style: italic;">The Alchemist's Key</a>, her other books <span style="font-style: italic;">The Celestial Triad</span> left me feeling somewhat disenchanted (what with the miasma of "New Age" that permeates those books), so much so that I didn't bother reading <span style="font-style: italic;">Ghostwriting</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Book of Dreams</span>.<br /><br />Happily her latest work, if the rest of the book is at all like the first few pages, seems to have taken a less grating approach to the supernatural. The prologue, an entry from the journal of a character, has about it a charm reminiscent, to my mind at least, of the era in which it is set. The odd turn of phrase seems a little <em>too</em> modern, but the overall effect is most pleasing.<br /><br />If you like fantasy, and are not averse to a bit of incarnation-hopping, then I'd thoroughly recommend giving Traci Harding a read.<br /><hr/>On a related note, Voyager are celebrating their <a href="http://www.voyageronline.com.au/10/index.htm">10th birthday</a>. Part of this (see the link) is a book containing a "sneak peek" of some of this years new books. I'm looking forward to a number of them, especially <a href="http://www.voyageronline.com.au/authors/profile.cfm?Author=162">Trudi Canavan</a>'s new book: <span style="font-style: italic;">Priestess of the White</span>, due for release in November.<br /><br />Another book on my list of eagerly awaited new titles is <a href="http://www.deverry.com">Katherine Kerr</a>'s new book: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gold Falcon</span> (presumably to be published by <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com.au/authors/author_profile.cfm?Author=0000191">HarperCollins</a> here in Australia). There are <a href="http://www.deverry.com/goldexpt1.html">two</a> <a href="http://www.deverry.com/goldexpt2.html">excerpts</a> available on her web site.
