Yesterday, I <a href="http://troacss.blogspot.com/2005/06/fantasy-books.html">began reading</a> <a href="http://www.voyageronline.com.au/books/title.cfm?ISBN=0732273927&Author=18" style="font-style: italic">The Gene of Isis</a> by <a href="http://www.voyageronline.com.au/traciharding/">Traci Harding</a>.<br /><br />I've just finished reading part one of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gene of Isis</span> and, I must say, I am slightly disappointed. I began the book hoping that Harding would manage to avoid some of the more cloying "New Age" themes in her earlier works, but soon enough the mischievous elemental spirits emerged (if only in mention) accompanied with the various psychic and auric phenomena of the Indic tradition (if I recall my New Age hype correctly) so popular amongst the New Age community.<br /><br />Part one is set in 19th century England. The main character Ashlee Granville is a young woman with psychic abilities having to deal with "coming out" into high society and the attendant problems, such as marrying, that confront her. While the characters mannerisms and dialogue have a tinge of the formality characteristic of the era, I still get the impression of a certain modernity, especially with respect to Ashlee. Perhaps a more formal turn of phrase, circumlocutious though it might be, would lend the story an air more appropriate to a story set in such times.<br /><br />Disappointing though these points are (especially Harding's approach to the mystical, which is difficult to credit as anything other than a kowtow toward the popular New Age movement), the tale is well-told; the premise, intriguing; and the characters, especially Ashlee, engaging.<br /><br />If you can bring yourself to brave the New Age elements of the story (or perhaps have enjoyed Harding's other stories, especially <span style="font-style:italic;">The Alchemist's Key</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ancient Future Trilogy</span>) then I would heartily recommend reading <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gene of Isis</span>. If, on the other hand, the more popularist New Age approach to the supernatural makes you cringe, perhaps you'd better pass this one over and save yourself $AU29.95.
