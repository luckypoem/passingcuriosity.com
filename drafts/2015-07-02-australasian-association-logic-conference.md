Yesterday I saw a tweet from [Greg Restall][consequently] mentioning
that the Australasian Association of Logic annual conference was being
held at the University of Sydney today and tomorrow and have taken a few
days off to tag along and learn some more about logic. Here are some
notes about what I've learned.
