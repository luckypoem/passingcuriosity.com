Using squared error as fitness function.

Generally assume that even high-dimensional data are "living" on a smooth
surface (a manifold) somehow embedded in the higher dimensional space. E.g:
points on a plane which is rolled up in a 3D space.

20x26 pixel grayscale images of faces -> 560 dimensions (1 pixel each).

Machine learning: deal with large datasets, lots of values with lots of
dimensions (100,000 dimension feature spaces). A lot of experimentation:
different models, different algorithms, different parameters (polynomial
order); need to record and document everything; proving that results (in a
paper) are valid. Wrote *elefant* toolkit to simplify distribution of code for
validation, teaching, etc. purposes (as well as making things easier).
