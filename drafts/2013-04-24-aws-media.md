title: "AWS Summit: Media"
---

Enormous growth in three important factors

- Formats

- Users - US peak sees 2/3 ("65%") of traffic is streamed video, 1/2 of that is
  Netflix.

- Size - much higher quality videos, kept for much longer.

Much harder:

- Many, complex media formats
- Processing is much more complex than historically.
- Security, DRM, etc.

> Transcoding is an almost perfect usecase for the cloud: you need large
> amounts of compute for a short period of time.

# Media storage

Use S3 for reliable, secure, scalable storage of large files (up to 5TB),
including media. Push old files to cold storage in Amazon Glacier.

Use S3 multi-part upload makes the upload more reliable (single connection
failure won't kill a 99% complete 5TB file upload). A la Bittorrent.

# Media progressing

Media processing requires a range of resources: computational, memory,
network, storage, I/O.

Use CloudWatch to monitor queue length and scale up and down (start and kill
transcoder instances).

## Orchestration

Using SimpleWorkflow to orchestrate the media processing system.

## Transcoding

Elastic transcoding, included in free tier.

# Media Delivery

Use CloudFront for delivery; support RTMP streaming, HTTP and HTTPS. Supports
origins in S3, EC2 and outside AWS.
