When I attend a conference I usually leave with a few dozen files of notes and
the intention to write a series of blog posts about them but, with a few
exceptions, this has not yet happened. This year I'm making an effort to write
less extensive but actually completed posts about the conferences I attend.

There will be three more posts in this little series, one about each day of the
conference:

- [Thursday]()
- [Friday]()
- [Saturday]()
