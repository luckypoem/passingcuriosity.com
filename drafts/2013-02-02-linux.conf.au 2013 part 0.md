When I attend a conference I usually leave with a few dozen files of notes and
the intention to write a series of blog posts about them but, with a few
exceptions, this has not yet happened. This year I'm using a few free hours
the day after [linux.conf.au 2013](lca2013) to write up my notes about the
whole conference.

There will be five more posts in this little series, one about each day of the
conference:

- [Monday](/2013/)
- [Tuesday]()
- [Wednesday]()
- [Thursday]()
- [Friday]()
