# SSH Mastery

The first book I read, @lucas2011ssh is an introduction to using SSH, focussing
on OpenSSH (as client and server) and PuTTY (as a client on Windows). The word
"mastery" is probably a bit strong but this book certainly covers all the
important bases in *using* SSH.

# DNSSEC Mastery

The second, more recent, book (@lucas2013dnssec) is an introduction to deploying
DNSSEC with bind.
