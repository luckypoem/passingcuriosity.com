Thursday began with a keynote by [Glyn Moody][gm] on the topics of openness
and sharing in free software, free culture, open science, open government, and
other worlds. What follows are my still rather rough notes on his talk.

A long time ago in Wellington saw a tea towel with "the world as viewed from
New Zealand". Made aware of a deep cultural bias.

Rebel code sept 1999, sept 2000. 50+ interviews with some of the key people
involved with this programme, this project, we're engaged in. Each and every
one of them was very nice; contrasts with the proprietary world which contains
some extraordinarily unpleasant people. Cultural difference (20 years
experience to judge by).

Sharing
========

Share nicely

Recursive sharing: sharing the art of sharing. Not just sharing F/OSS, also
helping others to apply the principals of F/OSS in other contexts (free
culture?)

Open Access
===========

23 August 1991. "I'm doing a (free) OS for 386 AT clones."

16 August 1991. arXiv.org, repository for preprints in physics. Paul Ginspar?
knew about GNU, etc.

Public Library of Science (2001): expanding the idea of open access to sharing
articles freely online. Entire journals, of open access. Inspired by
arXiv.org, free software, open genomic database.

Open Genomics
=============

Human Genome Project

- 1990 - 2000+
- cost $3 billion

DNA is inherently digital. Quadwernary (GTCA) rather than binary.

"Digital Code of Life" - same book as Rebel Code, with a few words changed.

Wasn't freely available until 1996 with the Bermuda Principles: "finished
annotated sequences should be submitted immediately to the public databases"
Science, especially in life sciences, had become *property*

Pushed through by Sir John Sulston (Nobel for Med, 2002,, Fortran hacker).
Considered using F/OSS licensing, but decided just public domain.

2000 race with Craig Venter's Celera. Wanted to beat the public programme,
find the genes which code for proteins (which the US was patenting). Talked to
Bill Gates about setting up a proprietary gene company.

Won by lone hacker, Jim Kent. Worked on HGP, Supervisor said "they're going to
win." Knocked up a Linux cluster of 100 PCs with 800MHz Pentiums, 256 MB RAM.
Wrote the program to process the data, won by a few days and released into the
public domain. Without the free software, they wouldn't have been able to
afford the hardware to do this. Biggest victory for F/OSS.

Genomic data routinely open; rest of science is moving [back] in that
direction. Science not just publishing "black box" results, but also
publishing the "source code" data. (The stolen emails are "because" they
horded their data.)

Blue ??? group in chemoinformatics.

Open Access to results
Open Data
Open Science

- sharing the process of science openly

- open notebook science - sharing the experience daily or hourly via blogs,
  wikis, etc.

- "release early, release often"

Shoring lies at the heart of the sci proc. All science is open science, it's a
matter of degree.

Sharing also lies at the hear of th artistic creation

- you buold on the work of others
- you'll be the basis for future work

Project Gutenberg
-----------------

1971

Act of sharing born of sharing

- Michael Hart given ops account on a Xeros machine

- Decided to used it to share etexts. Typed in US Declaration of Independence,
  roughly 5K of ASCII.

- Try to send it to "everyone" (on ARPAnet)

1991 - just 10 ebooks (tyoing )
1997 - there were 1000

6 August 1991, WWW went public

Mirror at University of Carolina. 1992 SunSITE was launched there as a
"central repository for public-domain ..."

LDP founded in 1992 (originally in LaTeX, then HTML). Almost imm. licensing
became an issue. License to stop commercial publishing.

Open Content Licensing
----------------------

GPL in 1989
FDL in 2000

OpenContent License 1998, then Open Publication License (1999) by David Wiley.

Copyright's Commons: coalition set up by Larry Lessig in 1999. Counter
copyright initiative drawing explicitly on free software.

Creative Commons: more ambitious and rigorous programme, set up in 2001. Some
are more restrictive. 

GFDL 1.3 has clause to relicence certain wikis to be relicensed under the CC
BY-SA-NC.

Jimmy Wales first used Gnuhoo/DMOZ/Open Dir Project for commercial purposes.

Started GNUpedia (Nupedia) in 2000

Breakthrough came by using wiki (built in Perl)

**Wikimania**

Probably the single best way to explain how free software works - because it's
easy for them to understand.

Millennium of Sharing
---------------------

Web pages (source code)
Blogs, delicious, etc.
Flickr/YouTube/scribd/SlideShare
MySpace/Facebook
Twitter/Identi.ca ("release early; release often" applied to thinking)

All predicated on the idea that people have stuff that they want to share with
others.

Sharing in the Real World
-------------------------

Sharing and openness is leaking into the real world.

Deeply problematic:

- companies (getting feedback, question they have to deal with)
- governments (we're daring to ask questions of those in power)

Open Government
---------------

Only a few (200ish).

US: 

Towards a 21st Century Government change.gov blog post adopting CC license for
site. Freedom of Info Act memo "accountability through transparency"
Accountability through transparency memo.

"Open Government" us satll traditional fgov. Toekn release of data. Not so
much "open source" as "shared source" government - a bit of a Microsoft
approach: look but don't touch.

End of the World
----------------

Global financial crisis: stock markets, forex, derivatives are essentially
gambling. These people try to guess the future, find someone who disagrees and
bet a trillion on it. November 2008: credit default swaps covered $40
trillion; they can just make up numbers and find some mug to bet against.

Gambling is a zero-sum game: for every winner, there is a loser (and we get to
pick of the pieces for the losers).

Environmental problems: all classic tragedies of the commons. We all try to
get "our share" before everyone else. Worse than zero-sum: everyone looses.

Both of these are anti-sharing:

- my gain is your loss (finance)
- my gain is our loss (environment)

Anti-sharing does not scale:

- Untethered financial instruments can destroy the underlying economy
- Untethered envrionmental consumption can destroy the world

We need to share. Impossible with financial system based on rewarding
gambling, short-term exploitation, etc. Need different approach to financial
systems: the commons.

Form of ownership in common. One of the 2009 Nobel laureates for Economic
Sciences was Elinor Ostrom for, in part, her work on commons.

For 25 years we've been showing others how to create and nurture sustainable
commons through openness and sharing/. Demonstrating that there is an
alternative

We are the tea towel.

Questions
---------

Barclays in Guardian: using complexity to avoid tax because IR couldn't afford
the enormous resources required to analyse their financials. There has been a
complicity between government and the companies and individuals who've made
this mess.

Journalism and science: journalists looking at early release science
(unreviewed) have published some interestingly wrong articles. Journalists
need to think about what they do and developing more/better critical
evaluation.

How can we take this out of this room? Get out there and talk to those who are
just getting started. There are lots of people who are very timid about doing
this sort of thing (they aren't used to sharing); getting out and helping them
to get started and begin sharing.

What's your view of the current hacker community engaging in its own brand of
opacity? Jargon, etc. are a creation of another elite. But there are projects
like Firefox that have been successful in reaching out to the general public.

Sharing information is easy and almost free. Resources and "money" aren't
free. But Elinor Ostrom's work shows that this works in the real world to
manage fish stocks, etc.

Returning to things like the Friendly societies, etc. were converted into
regular banks. Cooperatives have been turned into normal companies.

(John Graves wrote CD "PC Tours, your guide to ...") Open source education,
open courseware, etc. Applying the ideas about openness and sharing to the
educational domain. Pioneered by MIT, giving away the resources created by an
educational edifice. Get the impression that the educational world is a bit
conservative in adopting this sort of thing (political issue). Tells young
people about the benefits of collaboration, sharing, openness.

When did sharing become a dirty word and why did we let it? Not sure, but
copyright law getting stronger and stronger and stronger is certainly
something. Promoting intellectual monopolies (the reality of copyright, etc.)
They've managed to reframe the debate to make it about "property" rather than
"monopolies" This is a *lie* and many people don't realise. Push the sharing
is good meme; why are people getting arrested for sharing?
