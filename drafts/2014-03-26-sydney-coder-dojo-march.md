I went to my first "coding dojo" event last night with the
[Sydney Coding Dojo][1] meetup group. A *coding dojo* is "a meeting
where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming
challenge". [Last night][2] the topic was test driven development in
Scala using the [specs2][3] library.

Eric Torreborre, the developer of Specs2, gave a quick introduction to
the library (and a tiny bit of Scala) before the development kicked
off. He used the presentation slides below, but glossed over quite a
bit of the material to give us just enough to get going.

minutes!) the group
