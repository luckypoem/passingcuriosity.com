Welcome to my rather disorganised blog. Most of what you'll find
here are notes about books and articles I've read, problems I've
solved, and events I've attended. Prominent topics include
[Drupal][], [Haskell][], and [events][] related to programming and
IT.

[Drupal]: /tag/drupal/
[Haskell]: /tag/haskell/
[events]: /tag/event/
