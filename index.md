I registered the domain *Passing Curiosity* with the intention that it become
a productive outlet for my rather short attention span. Rather than waste
man-years clicking "Open Link in New Tab" on [Wikipedia][wp], I would make that
time productive by summarising what I read. Dead time, no more!

Alas, I got distracted. Nearly three years have passed and *Passing Curiosity*
is still just a neglected blog. Over the years I've maintained a few and almost
everything I posted to any of them can be found here.

The most **recent posts** are:

The rest, you can find in [the archives](/archives/).
