In the screen capture above, you can see that this Nigerian scam email has a couple of ads (for Yahoo! messenger) appended to it. This is probably the result of some bit of filth spammer sending their message from Yahoo!'s web-mail service to an e-mail list instead of doing the job properly. It appears as though spammers standards, low though they have always been, are slipping.
