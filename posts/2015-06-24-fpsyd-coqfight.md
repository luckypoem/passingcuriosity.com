excerpt: 
  Last night was the second annual FP-Syd Coq Fight, the only competitive
  theorem proving event in the world! Here are some notes and a recording
  of the final round live stream.

The FP-Syd Coq Fight is an annual event in which Coq users demonstrate their
prowess in competitive theorem proving. Each bout sees two competitors race to
prove a lemma before their opponent and before the timer runs out.

It didn't even occur to me that we might broadcast this prestigious sporting
event live on the Internet until near the end of the event, so here is
a recording of my Periscope live stream of the semi-final and final bouts.

This is the second time FP-Syd has had a Coq Fight and it again was far more
enjoyable than the phrase "competitive theorem proving" might suggest. Indeed,
there's even been some suggestion that there could be a far less prestigious
"minor leagues" Coq Fight at [ICFP 2015](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/)
in Vancouver later this year.
