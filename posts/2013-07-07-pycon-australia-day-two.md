I'm attending [PyCon Australia 2013][1] in Hobart, Tasmania. [DjangoCon
Australia 2013][dca] and [day one of PyCon Australia 2013][pca1] were both
fantastic, and I expect today to be just as good. I'll try to update this post
over the course of the day. Not real live blogging, more delayed telecast
blogging.

I'm typing these notes during the sessions, so there may be errors and
omissions. Any such problems are my fault and not that of the speakers.

[Today's programme](http://2013.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule/sunday) is
pretty much jam packed with interesting-looking talks. You'll be able to find
videos of all the talks on [pyvideo.org](http://pyvideo.org/) eventually.
