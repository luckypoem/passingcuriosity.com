  I've given two talks in the last week or so: one on Retcon and another on
  dynamic programming in Haskell. Here are the slides.

As promised in a previous post, I've posted the slides for the two talks I've
recently presented to my [Speaker Deck account][1].

[Retcon: imposing eventual consistency on disparate data sources][2] was
presented at the [Yow! Lambda Jam][3] conference on May 21 2015; and

[Dynamic programming in Haskell][4] was presented at [FP-Syd][5] on May 27
2015.

NB: The algorithms presented are as described in [Introduction to
Algorithms][6] (2nd ed) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein; the
Haskellisation is mine.
