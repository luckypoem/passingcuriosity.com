[The Seikai Trilogy][1]

I made the mistake of going into [Impact Comics][2] on the way back to school
today, and came out the owner of all three volumes of the Seikai Trilogy manga
(redone in English by Tokyopop).

What I've seen of the anime (Crest of Stars, Banner of Stars and some of Banner
of Stars II) that was based on the original novels is brilliant. It is
fascinating watching the characters and their relationships grow and develop
over the course of however many years.

Whilst in the shop, I noticed that they have most of Lone and Cub (forgive the
lack of a link, but I can't find the [Dark Horse][3] site for the series
anymore), which I'll have to finish off as I bought the first 19 volumes whilst
I was in England a few years ago.

They also have a lot of stuff that just looks interesting. I can feel my fluid
fiscal state evaporating as I think about it.
