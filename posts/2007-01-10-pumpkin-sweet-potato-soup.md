title: Pumpkin and sweet potato soup

Given that we've got half a pumpkin and a sweet potato to use up, I made a soup based on the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Spiced_Pumpkin_Soup">Spiced Pumpkin Soup</a> and <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Pumpkin_Soup">Pumpkin Soup</a> recipes from the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook">Wikibooks Cookbook</a>.

I made a few concessions to expediency (I only had dried onion, didn't have any garlic, etc.), but it turned out fairly well.

### Ingredients ###

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 tablespoons dried diced onion
- 3 tablespoons plain flour
- 1/2 teaspoon curry powder
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed
- 1/4 of a pumpkin, peeled and cubed
- 2 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1 litre vegetable stock
- 1 cup whole milk


### Method ###


1. Melt the butter in a large saucepan and add the onion, flour, and spices. Saut√© for a few minutes. 
2. Add stock, salt and vegetables. Boil until the vegetables are cooked.
3. If possible and desired, blend in a food processor until smooth (allow to cool for 10-20 minutes first).
4. Bring back to boil (if you blended it) and add the milk. Simmer for 5-10 minutes.
