In a <a href="http://megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=935">recent rant</a>, Fred Gallagher (<acronym title="also known as">a.k.a.</acronym> Piro) wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote>Don't just blow voting off like its a game you just aren't interested in playing. You are in the game, whether you like it or not. Not voting makes you an Non Player Character. Do you REALLY want to be a NPC, letting others decide what happens in the game?</blockquote>
