While [iTunes][1] does a decent job of managing MP3 enclosures in news feeds
(podcasts), [iPhoto][2] could really do with similar functionality. I have my
iBook randomly choose images from an album in my iPhoto library and it would be
fantastic if I could get iPhoto to automatically download pictures from some of
the fantastic sources on the 'net. Sites like [Botany Photo of the Day][3]
provide some amazing images.

I'll see if I can figure out how to do this over the summer as my first piece
of Mac software.

I had a quick go at knocking this up with [Automator][4], but it didn't work
very well as I can't seem to get Safari to extract the image URLs from an XML
feed and most interesting sites have a bunch of junk images as well
([Flickr][5], for example, has heaps and heaps of blank GIFs for spacing).
