I've just created a [Speaker Deck account][1] to store the slide decks from my
infrequent talks and presentations.

The only deck I've uploaded so far is [A Complete Idiot's Introduction to
Formal Concept Analysis for Dummies to Teach Themselves][2] which I presented
at the [FP-Syd][3] functional programming meeting in November, 2013.

Upcoming talks include:

- *retcon: imposing eventual consistency on disparate data sources* at the
[Yow! Lambda Jam][4] conference next month (May 21-22); and

- *An approach to dynamic programming in Haskell* at FP-Syd a few days later on
May 27.
