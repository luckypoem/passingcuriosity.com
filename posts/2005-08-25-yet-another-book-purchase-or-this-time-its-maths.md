Recent <a href="http://datamining.anu.edu.au/student/math3346_2005.html">Data Mining</a> lectures have been looking at the <emph>Apriori Principle</emph>. The discussion of a set-theoretic framework within which to consider data mining (more specifically, market basket analysis) prompted me to have a look in the maths section of the <a href="http://www.coop-bookshop.com.au/">Coop Bookshop</a> for a book on the topic.<br /><br />I came out with a copy of <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521784514">Introduction to Lattices and Order</a>. What [little] I've read of it so far is very well written.<br /><br />The bad news is that I need to get back into reading so that I can write the literature review and background sections of my thesis without screwing anything up or misrepresenting anything too badly. I have a feeling that it's going to be a <emph>long</emph> time before I finish up the <emph style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">17</emph> books I've got bookmarks in.
