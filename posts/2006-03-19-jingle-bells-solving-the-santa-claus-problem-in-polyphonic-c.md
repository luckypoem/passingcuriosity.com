<a class="title" href="">Jingle Bells: Solving the Santa Claus Problem in Polyphonic C#</a> by Nick Benton.<br /><br />This paper presents the solution to the Santa Claus problem in the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/polyphony/">Polyphonic C#</a> language. Polyphonic C# is an extension of Microsoft's C# language with concurrency primitives based on those of the <a href="http://moscova.inria.fr/index.shtml">join calculus</a>. It was intended for use in "orchestrating distributed applications built on asynchronous messaging," but is "equally applicable to programming with multiple threads in a shared-memory environment."<br /><br />This is, the authors claim, another piece of evidence supporting the claim that the join calculus is an effective basis for concurrent, as well as distributed, programming.<br /><br /><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&cluster=8641565189116214780">Google</a> | <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/944b7b261b4409f876b2ba9f8a82bb66">Del.icio.us</a> | <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/article/556532">CiteULike</a> | <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/479">LtU</a>
