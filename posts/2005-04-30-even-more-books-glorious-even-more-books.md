I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590592395/" style="font-style: italic;">Practical Common Lisp</a> from the Co-op Bookshop yesterday. Looks promising.<br /><br />Now all I'm waiting for is <span style="font-style: italic;">Types and Programming Languages</span> (at the <a href="http://www.coop-bookshop.com.au/">Co-op Bookshop</a>) and a bunch of comics (at <a href="http://www.impactcomics.com.au/">Impact Comics</a>).<br /><br />Now I have four books to read...<br />Plus numerous papers...<br />I pity my eyes.
