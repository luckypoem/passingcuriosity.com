In an effort to blog more regularly and to post content that is more mine
than transcriptions of others, I'll be writing a regular round-up of the
events I attend. To start with, here are a few from the last three weeks.

# Australian OpenStack User Group

I've recently started working at [Anchor Systems][anchor] and sit next to some
of the people working on the new [Anchor OpenStack cloud][anchor-os], so I've
been hearing (and overhearing) quite a bit about OpenStack and OpenStack
deployment recently. One of the things that sounded quite interesting is
"OpenStack On OpenStack" (or "Triple O") -- which uses an existing OpenStack
cloud to bootstrap and manage a new OpenStack cloud. The recent [Australian
OpenStack User Group][os-meetup] at the Anchor Systems offices in Sydney had
several talks about Triple O.

# Sydney PostgreSQL User Group

I've always quite liked [PostgreSQL][] but my current project is my first
chance to work with it in a while. The [Sydney PostgreSQL User
Group][pg-meetup] meeting last week had a presentation by Venkata B Nagothi
from Fujitsu Australia about the changes in the forthcoming PostgreSQL 9.4
release.

# Port80 Sydney

I was a regular attendee at Port80 in Perth for years, but haven't been to
[Post80 Sydney][p80-meetup] since I moved here 18 months ago. The meeting last
week was hosted at Anchor, so I stuck around after work to eat some pizza and
listen to the talk about user experience design.
