Watched <a class="title"
href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0079574/">Moonraker</a> again last night.
Was surprised at how repulsive I found Mr. Bond. Perhaps shouldn't have
been. I much prefer <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000112/">Pierce
Brosnan's</a> Bond; if nothing else he doesn't come over as such an
arrogant cad.
