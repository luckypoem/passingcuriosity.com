<a class="title" href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?tr_id=845">Integrating support for undo with exception handling</a> by Avraham Shinnar; David Tarditi; Mark Plesko and Bjarne Steensgaard.<br /><br />This paper appears to have as its object a solution to similar problems as those addressed by software transactional memory; i.e: maintaining memory consistency. Where <acronym title="software transactional memory">STM</acronym> provides transactions that can be used to implement multithreaded programmes much more simply that traditional explicit locking approaches, this paper uses a similar mechanism to handle unexpected failures (uncaught exceptions) and roll-back the effects of the failed code.<br /><br />he authors describe their implementation of an undo mechanism in Bartok, an experimental optimising <acronym title="C-Sharp">C#</acronym> compiler and <acronym title="Common Language Runtime">CIL</acronym> runtime. Their system extends <acronym title="C-Sharp">C#</acronym> with a <code>try_all</code> block which acts as a catch-all exception handler. If an exception propagates is raised within a <code>try_all</code> block and is not handled before it reaches the scope of the block, then the roll-back mechanism is engaged.<br /><br />The main difference between <acronym>Haskell</acronym>'s <acronym title="software transactional memory">STM</acronym> is the goal: where <acronym title="software transactional memory">STM</acronym> is concerned with maintaining memory consistency in the face of concurrently executing threads, this system is concerned with simplifying error handling and recovery.<br /><br /><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&cluster=14653294056375713537">Google</a> | <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/article/556290">CiteULike</a> | <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/bebcb6d727d580ce2181b126bbada351">Del.icio.us</a> | <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/446">LtU</a><br /><br /><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong> <a rel="tag" href="http:/del.icio.us/thsutton/programming">Programming</a> <a rel="tag" href="http:/del.icio.us/thsutton/cs">CS</a> <a rel="tag" href="http:/del.icio.us/thsutton/papers">Papers</a></span>
