<a href="http://www.apple.com/podcasting/">Apple - iTunes - Podcasting</a>
<br />With the new iTunes update, I've been able to throw out one more of the third-party applications on my iBook: <a href="http://ipodder.sourceforge.net/">iPodder</a>.
<br />
<br />Pretty soon, I won't need any thing but the applications OS X ships with (plus LaTeX and iWork).
