I've spent the day at the [2013 AWS Summit, Sydney][1] hearing a bunch of
people talk about AWS and related products. The programme included a keynote
followed by three tracks of six presentations each and ended with a drinks
session.

I felt that the keynote -- including APAC and global AWS executives and three
customers -- was far too long and that a lot of the content could have been
trimmed.

The highlight of the day, for me, was James Bromberger's overview of **your
first week with Amazon EC2**. He very quickly described the first few steps of
using EC2 including: security groups, RDS, monitoring with CloudWatch, using
multiple availability zones, autoscaling, IAM, and CloudFormer.

This was closely followed by Simon Elisha about **continuous deployment
practices, with production, test and development environments running on
AWS**. I'm always interested in learning more about CI and CD (one of these
days I'll even *use* them) and this was an interesting, though also quite
high- level, discussion of CI and CD using AWS.

The other sessions I saw were interesting enough but quite high-level and I
got the impression that they were aimed at CIOs and the like more than
technical people like me.

I got enough out of it to not regret going, but I don't think I'll go to
another similar event.
