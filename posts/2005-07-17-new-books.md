I've just bought two new books: <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/" style="font-style: italic;">Freakonomics</a> and <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521663504" style="font-style: italic;">Purely Functional Data Structures</a>.<br /><br />I'll read <span style="font-style: italic;">PFDS</span> fairly immediately (as I'm hoping it'll help me with my <a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/">honours project</a>), but I've got a feeling the <span style="font-style: italic;">Freakonomics</span> is going to have to wait a while.
