  Drupal as the Winning Web Platform.
---

Josh started by asking #php "what CMS do you like?" On Howard Dean's campaign
with the DeanSpace stuff (2003), turned into CivicSpace (2004), Chapter 3,
Pantheon.

Services as Internet applications, not just web sites: Google, Facebook,
SalesForce, etc. But most of the web is still content. Sharing, commenting,
etc., etc., but it's still mostly content.

The web isn't dead, but the problems of managing content are largely unsolved.
There is an enormous variety in the content management space, market niches,
technical approaches, workflow orientations.

Most approaches live in vertical silos. There is no "core content technology"
to work across these different silos. You need a lot of glue to use the best
e-commerce solution with the best blog solution. After more than 15 years,
this is still a problem!?!

The NYT employs more than 100 web developers, they don't also need to invent
and manufacture their own printing presses. Risky, expensive, difficult to
maintain.

Platforms beget services. Mollom, GVS Security Scan, NodeSquirrel Backups.
