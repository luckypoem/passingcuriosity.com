Now You're In Business - Making a living with Drupal
====================================================

Allie Micka, Advantage Labs. Support Drupal developers and projects. 

Drupal is Your Worst Nightmare
==============================

The first thing many new contacts say is that they hate Drupal,

it doesn't work as expected
---------------------------

It can be hard to bridge the gap between client expectations ("I want a
forum", which means phpBB2 with every extension ever known) with developer
expectations ("I want a forum" which means enabling the forum module).


it's expensive to customise
---------------------------

Rocking up to a restaurant with a photo of a meal and saying "I'd like this"
is a big problem; many Drupal projects face similar challenges from the client
side.

Good help is hard to find
-------------------------

The ease of use, miscommunications, etc. often happen when the person making
use of the power of Drupal isn't experienced in the ways of Drupal. "Certified
to Rock" type sites to find people, but comes with issues of its own ("I need
to hire a rockstar?")

It does things I don't care about
---------------------------------

All I want is a blog/site/etc. but Drupal does so much stuff I don't care
about.

Drupal is Good for Business
===========================

Good for site owners: you get much, most, or more than all of the
functionality of your site for free using Drupal. Dropping Drupal in the face
of challenges is throwing the baby out with the bath water: you can build
$100,000 worth of functionality in an afternoon.

Community, collaboration, etc.

Drupal is Good for Developers
=============================

Kind of like a franchise (shared brand, etc.), never alone with the community
centred on drupal.org, finding new people is easier than with custom stuff
(shared background, shared language, less training required).

Every new feature attracts new users. New users mean new contributors. New
contributors add more features (which attract more users...)

Building with Drupal - Avoiding a nightmare
===========================================

Some suggestions -- a roadmap, even -- to help avoid the nightmare that some
Drupal projects can run into.

**Start with goals** -- what you want to accomplish as an organisation -- and
document them at the start of the project. "Business" goals that need to be
accomplished, not the administrative details of deadlines, etc.

**Acknowledge and support participants** -- if you want to add a blog or forum to
your site, you'll need to have some bloggers and some forum users.

**Make sustainable choices** -- cutting corners, hacking core, ignoring best
practices will bring pain. 

**Understand the economy of the community** -- be a member of the community,
don't be a support vampire, actually give back to community by doing or
supporting the people actually doing the development.

Building a Drupal career: Using what we've learned
==================================================

**Find the place you fit within the community** -- trainers, developers,
themers, project managers and evangelists all have places in the community.

**Acknowledge and support other participants** -- create a process that
supports people, keeps goals in mind, etc. Which process you use doesn't
matter (waterfall, agile, etc.) having one that works is key.

**Budget your time** -- many developers increase their hourly rate after the
first few projects. You need to spend time learning best practices, doing
non-billable development.

**Explain the long-term costs** -- acknowledge and manage long-term costs in
meeting the goals. Back to the issue with shortcuts.

**Make the community work for you** -- know contributors, pay attention to
people (good karma), do support, etc. Then you'll be able to reap the rewards
with support, etc.

**Giving back** -- thinking about it in terms of "charity" doesn't make sense
(all these big businesses wouldn't be doing it). Focus on what you get out of
"giving back": ownership of features, good karma gettinf faster and better
support, collaboration.

**Client-funded projects** -- few people can make a living on just Drupal
development but lots can convince their clients to support development of
features they need.

**"Development plus"** -- working on the same projects over and over and over
again you'll see needs. It takes an hour to duplicate the page module and add a
field, but 10,000s of hours to implement CCK. You can't do that client-funded,
but you can add a bit of time to every project.

**Develop of product offering** -- a lot people seem to be moving in this
direction. Pick a vertical, build services for it. Lot of hosted services for
non-profits that can be competed against with Drupal.

**Direct funding** -- not normal, but more possible than realised. Rather than
wasting small grants on one-off projects, give larger grants to build real
technology improvements.

**Bounties** -- don't really work, but funding for sprints is kinda similar and
does work.

There's still a lot to do
=========================

Thousands of people are able to feed themselves, but there's still more to do in
establishing best practices, moving more people from developer to contributor,
etc.

This was all about 5% of a book that's due in a few months:

2011, *The definitive guide to Drupal 7.* Apress: ???.

Questions
=========

On convincing clients to give back: long term sustainability, vender neutrality,
etc. But still wind up having to sell "an extra 40 hours and it'll be great
later, maybe".

Establish your system and work to it. Don't feel that you have to take everything
that comes along and ignore your process.

There should be a lot of client education built into most projects.
